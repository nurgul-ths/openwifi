# Data-Management Scripts

This repository contains Python scripts for managing and processing wireless experiment data generated by openwifi boards.

## Scripts

### Raw Data Processing

#### [script_process_side_ch_files.py](script_process_side_ch_files.py)

Processes side channel data files from wireless experiments. These are generated by `dac_intf_canc_ctl.c` or `ch_hopping_ctl.c` in the openwifi repository (they generate data in the same format).

**Purpose:** Reads multi-part capture files, extracts experiment parameters, processes IQ data, updates log files.

**Usage:**
1. Set `PATH_DATA` variable to the directory containing side channel data files. Note that it will traverse subdirectories too.
2. Run: `python script_process_side_ch_files.py`

**Data Format:**
- Input: Text files with names matching `*_capture_side_ch_side_info_*.txt`
- Output: Processed IQ data and experiment information

#### [script_process_lms_update_files.py](script_process_lms_update_files.py)

Processes error and weight files from LMS updates. These are generated by `dac_intf_canc_ctl.c` in the openwifi repository.

**Purpose:** Converts binary files to CSV, calculates error values in dB, separates real and imaginary weight components.

**Usage:**
1. Set `PATH_DATA` variable to the folder containing LMS update files.
2. Run: `python script_process_lms_update_files.py`

**Data Format:**
- Input: Binary files with names like `error_info_*` and `weight_info_*`
- Output: CSV files with processed error and weight data

### Data Organization and Conversion

#### [script_create_database.py](script_create_database.py)

Creates an overview of datasets by extracting information from log files. This is used by post-processing scripts to easily access experiment information.

**Purpose:** Generates a database of experiment metadata, organizes data for each subset, and creates/updates JSON files with experiment information.

**Usage:**
1. Set `PATH_REPO` and `PATH_DATA` variables.
2. Run: `python script_create_database.py`

#### [script_create_hdf5_files.py](script_create_hdf5_files.py)

Converts CSV files to HDF5 format for more efficient storage and access.

**Purpose:** Walks through directories to find CSV files, converts to HDF5 for efficient storage and access.

**Usage:**
1. Set `PATH_REPO` and `PATH_DATA` variables.
2. Run: `python script_create_hdf5_files.py`

#### [script_interim_addon.m](script_interim_addon.m)

MATLAB script for data appending.

## Data Generation and Shared Resources

The data processed by these scripts is primarily generated by two C programs in the openwifi repository:

1. `dac_intf_canc_ctl.c`: Generates LMS update files and side channel data for cancellation experiments.
2. `ch_hopping_ctl.c`: Generates side channel data for channel hopping experiments.

Both programs use the `ow_file.h` header file for common file handling functionality, including double buffering, automatic file rotation, and thread-safe writing operations.

These data management scripts provide a comprehensive pipeline for processing, organizing, and analyzing data from openwifi experiments, ensuring efficient storage and easy access for further analysis.
